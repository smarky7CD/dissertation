abstract = {Identifying the most frequent elements in a data stream is a well known and difficult problem. Identifying the most frequent elements for each individual, especially in very large populations, is even harder. The use of fast and small memory footprint algorithms is paramount when the number of individuals is very large. In many situations such analysis needs to be performed and kept up to date in near real time. Fortunately, approximate answers are usually adequate when dealing with this problem. This paper presents a new and innovative algorithm that addresses this problem by merging the commonly used counter-based and sketch-based techniques for top-k identification. The algorithm provides the top-k list of elements, their frequency and an error estimate for each frequency value. It also provides strong guarantees on the error estimate, order of elements and inclusion of elements in the list depending on their real frequency. Additionally the algorithm provides stochastic bounds on the error and expected error estimates. Telecommunications customer’s behavior and voice call data is used to present concrete results obtained with this algorithm and to illustrate improvements over previously existing algorithms.}

 	DOI={10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006023}, 
 	abstractNote={Over the past decade, various intrusion detection and prevention systems have been proposed to detect DDoS attacks and mitigate the caused damage. However, many existing IDS systems still keep per-flow state to detect anomaly, and thus do not scale with link speeds in multi-gigabit networks. In this paper, we present a two-level approach for scalable and accurate DDoS attack detection by exploiting the asymmetry in the attack traffic. In the coarse level, we use a modified count-min sketch (MCS) for fast detection, and in the fine level, we propose a bidirectional count sketch (BCS) to achieve better accuracy. At both detection levels, sketch structures are utilized to ensure the scalability of our scheme. The main advantage of our approach is that it can track the victims of attacks without recording every IPaddress found in the traffic. Our scheme can save over 90\% key storage. Such feature is significant for the detection in the highspeed environment. Experimental results using the real Internet traffic show that our approach is able to quickly detect anomaly events and track those victims with a high level of accuracy.},
